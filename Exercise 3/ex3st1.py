# I didn't include the results of the arithmetic operations in the comments, however I did 
# convert them in so far it was possible to proper equations if you can't initially figure 
# out why the result is what it is.

# Prints the string "I will now count my chickens:"
print "I will now count my chickens:"

# Prints the string "Hens" followed by the sum of 25 + (30/6)"
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
# Prints the string "Roosters" followed by the sum of 100-(mod((25 * 3)4))
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

# Prints the string "Now I will count the eggs:"
print "Now I will count the eggs:"

# Prints sum of (mod(4,2)/4) 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 6. (The expression in brackets is equal to zero)
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

# Prints the string "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

# Prints boolean operation of 3 + 2 < 5 - 7
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

# Prints the string "What is 3 + 2?" and the sum of 3 + 2
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
# Prints "What is 5 - 7?" and the sum of 5 - 7
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

# Prints the string "Oh, that's why it's False."
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

# Prints the string "How about some more."
print "How about some more."

# Prints the String "Is it greater?" with the boolean operation 5 > -2
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
# Prints the string "Is it greater or equal?" and the boolean operation 5 >= -2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
# Prints the string "Is it less or equal?" and 5 <= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
